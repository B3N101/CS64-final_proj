This is the code for final project for CS64 at Middlesex school done by Ben Feuer and Ian Lam.

In this project we will use opencv to detect features in a car object detection dataset and then use a neural network to classify the images. We will then compare the performances of these neural network we use such as r-cnn, faster r-cnn, and yolo.
